# Barricaded World

## Description

Original [Barricaded World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2696986935) with fixes and sandbox vars for B42 ONLY until author updates.

> This version exposes sandbox options for tweaking chances. It also adds a chance for garages to be broken.

> [!NOTE]
> Garages sometimes don't fully break, only parts of the garage door break, I'm not knowledgeable enough on Zomboids lua api yet to figure out whats going on.

> [!NOTE]
> This includes the error spam fix for B42 by [Amenophis](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2696986935/563626489222803655/#c595152144826431052).

See [original mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2696986935) for description. Some default values have been
changed, check the sandbox options for updated defaults.
